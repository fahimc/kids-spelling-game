You are an experienced frontend developer tasked with creating *SpellyQuest*, a fun mobile-first Vite + React + TypeScript app to help kids practice spelling through a game-based experience.

Follow the instructions carefully:

---

## üèóÔ∏è Project Goal:
Create a mobile-first Vite+React+TypeScript app designed to help children aged 5‚Äì10 learn and practice spelling. The app should feel like a colorful and engaging game.

The game flow:
- Initial screen to input 10‚Äì20 spellings.
- Learning phase to teach the spelling.
- Fun mini-games to practice the spelling.
- Testing phase to assess spelling memory.
- Victory/reward screen at the end.

All screens must be mobile-first and designed for fun, excitement, and easy interaction.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture:

- **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Text-to-Speech**: Browser's `SpeechSynthesis` API
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage (to save progress)

### Folder Structure:

/src /assets -> Images, sounds /components -> Reusable UI elements (Button, InputField, GameCard, etc.) /pages -> WelcomePage, SpellInputPage, LearningPage, GamePage, TestPage, VictoryPage /context -> Global state management /utils -> Helper functions (shuffle letters, validate spelling) /hooks -> Custom hooks (e.g., useSpeechSynthesis) /styles -> Tailwind customization /status.md -> Status tracking file

## üìì Status Tracking - `/status.md`

After completing **every phase**, update `/status.md` with:

- **Phase Completed**
- **Summary of Changes**
- **Any Architecture Decisions**
- **Next Task**

### Example `/status.md` format:

```markdown
# Status Log: SpellyQuest

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- Initialized Vite + React + TypeScript project.
- Installed Tailwind CSS, React Router, Framer Motion.
- `npm create vite@latest spellyquest --template react-ts`
- Next: Set up folder structure and routing.

---

## Phase 2: Folder Structure and Routing
- Created folders: /pages, /components, /assets, /context, /hooks, /utils
- Set up React Router with basic routes.
- Created `App.tsx` skeleton.
- Next: Build Welcome Screen.
‚ö° Rules for Development:
Work strictly phase-by-phase.

Never skip phases.

Keep /status.md up-to-date.

Save work clearly and regularly.

If unsure about a decision, log the assumption in /status.md.

Focus on a playful, colorful, kid-friendly game look throughout.
